Associate professor at Université Paris 8 \|  Vincennes - Saint-Denis

<!-- After graduating from [ENSIMAG](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/) (<i>École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique et de Mathématiques Appliquées</i>, a computer science and applied mathematics school of engineer) in 2015, I obtained a master's degree in NLP at Université Paris-Sorbonne.
In 2020, I have defended my PhD in [Université Paris-Sorbonne](http://www.paris-sorbonne.fr/), 
[STIH team](http://www.stih.paris-sorbonne.fr/), under the supervision of [Karën Fort](http://www.schplaf.org/kf/) and Claude Montacié.<br/> (<a target="_blank" href="https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03083213v2">link to HAL</a>)
I was a postdoctoral researcher at Università Pascal Paoli, Corte, Corse (UMR CRNS 6240 LISA) from January 2022 to August 2022. I worked with Stella Retali Medori and Laurent Kevers. -->

            My research focuses on questionning whether crowdsourcing (and games with a purpose) can be used to gather linguistic resources for the so-called "less-resourced" languages.<br/><br/>

            I have developed a platform to enable collaborative part-of-speech annotation of an Alsatian (French regional language) corpus: <a href="http://bisame.paris-sorbonne.fr">BISAME</a>, and a platform to collect recipes, dialectal and spelling variants and POS tags for the Alsatian language <a href="http://bisame.paris-sorbonne.fr/recettes">Recettes de Grammaire (gsw)</a> and the Guadeloupean Creole <a href="http://krik.paris-sorbonne.fr/recettes">Recettes de Grammaire (gcf)</a>.
